# Artemis-Financial-Vulnerability-Assessment-Report

Artemis Financial is a consultant company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers. For this reason, Artemis Financial required a custom secure software that handles important data and creates a secure communicative environment. 
To create a secure environment, a checksum was successfully created using a personal access certificate and a vulnerability dependency check. What I did practically well was suppressing false positive dependencies that don't necessarily create a security
vulnerability, as it is wise to focus on the vulnerabilities with concrete evidence. It is important to consider these practices and correctly secure your code due to the security repercussions the program could have. Ignoring security measure could cause
program breaches that can be harmful to Artemis Financial, since they need to store sensitive data. The part of the vulnerability assessment that was helpful to me was the certificate generation as it was the last step of the assessment and it helped me 
determine how secure the program was. 

I increased levels of security by combining different security practices into one program; these being: multiple dependency checks, checksum generation, and code review. These are the most common security practices that help most simple to complex programs. 
Securing your program with these practices is the most beneficial way to move foward with other projects in the future. When a program is not fully secure with these three practices, that's when other security measures need to be implemented. I refractured 
the code by implementing functions that communicate with each other under the updated tools that were already in use. By doing this, I only had to verify the tools' vulnerabilities and apply the proper measures. The most helpful tools, or practices, that benefit these 
kinds of programs could be dependency checks, JUnit testing and checksum generation. After this detailed report of my program, I hypothesize that employers might review my project, especially the created functions implemented in the main class, and determine my 
knowledge, skill, and experience when it comes to software security. The attached assessment report demonstrates and supports this hypothesis.
